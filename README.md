# Digit-Recognition-ANN-CNN
Hand written digit recognition using ANN &amp; CNN model in TF + Keras

A tutorial on how to code in TensorFlow and keras. Userd MNIST hand written digit dataset to build a recognition model using i) KNN, ii) Logistic Regression, iii) Multilayer perceptron, and iv) Convolution Neural Network (CNN). 

Following the accuracy on test datset for each model

KNNL 97%
Logistic Regression: 92.6%
Multilayer perceptron: 97.6%
Convolution Neural Network: 99.8%
